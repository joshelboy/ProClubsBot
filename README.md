# ProClubsBot combined with Twitter API

Personal Project, using Tweepy and Requests.
Had a lot of problems with the easports.com website, but managed to filter the GET-requests and recreated them in "botv3.py".
The other files are no longer updated because they dont act like i want them to, but they should work if u enter ur Twitter-API token etc.
I am going to work further on the botv3.py in the next few days
